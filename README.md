# Predict-Sales-Revenue-with-scikit-learn
A simple Linear Regression model was developed to predict the sales revenue given the advertisement money spent on various platforms like TV, Newspapers, and Radio. Kaggle Advertising dataset consisting of 200 entries and 3 features was used to build the Linear Regression Model. Seaborn was used for Data Visualization and Analysis. The coef_ and intercept were diaplyed in the form of a dataframe to gather more information. The preidctions were made based on the largest coefficient.

MAE =  1.0097893815560148
MSE =  1.9476887245446184
RMSE = 1.3955961896424833
